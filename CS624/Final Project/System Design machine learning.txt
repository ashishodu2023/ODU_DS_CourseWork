    Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:
        Extract historical stock price data from the database.
        Prepare features such as moving averages, technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD), and other relevant factors that can influence the stock price.
        Split the data into training and testing datasets.

    Model Training:
        Train a machine learning model on the historical stock price data. You can use regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or more advanced models like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting.
        Tune hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation to optimize the model's performance.

    Model Deployment:
        Deploy the trained model as a service on AWS. You can use AWS Lambda, Amazon SageMaker, or Docker containers on Amazon ECS or EKS for deployment.
        Expose an endpoint to receive input data (e.g., historical features) and return predictions.

    Integration with Real-Time Data Pipeline:
        Integrate the prediction service with the real-time data pipeline.
        Periodically trigger the prediction service to generate forecasts based on the latest available data.
        Store the predicted values in the database along with timestamps for future reference.

    Monitoring and Evaluation:
        Monitor the performance of the prediction model over time.
        Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
        Set up alerts to notify stakeholders if the model performance degrades or deviates significantly from expectations.

    Feedback Loop and Model Updating:
        Implement a feedback loop to continuously improve the prediction model.
        Periodically retrain the model using new data and updated features.
        Use techniques like online learning or incremental training to incorporate new information without retraining the entire model from scratch.

    Visualization and Reporting:
        Visualize the predicted stock prices alongside actual prices to provide insights to users.
        Generate reports or dashboards summarizing the model's performance and forecasted trends.
