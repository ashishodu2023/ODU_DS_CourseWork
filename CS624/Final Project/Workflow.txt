1. Data Acquisition:

    Alpha Vantage API: Fetches real-time and historical stock price data in JSON format.
    Kafka Topic: Serves as a message queue to store real-time stock price data before processing.
    AWS Lambda (Kafka Consumer): Listens to the Kafka topic, consumes real-time stock price data, and triggers further processing.

2. Feature Pipeline:

    Bytewax: Processes incoming stock price data from Kafka, performs data normalization, and extracts relevant features for analysis.
    Feature Engineering: Extracts additional features from the normalized data, such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), or other technical indicators.
    Comet ML (Tracking): Logs the extracted features and metadata for model training and evaluation.

3. Training Pipeline:

    Spark DataFrame (or AWS Kinesis Data Analytics): Processes and analyzes real-time data streams from Kafka. Integrates machine learning models for predicting the next day's closing price.
    Machine Learning Model Training: Trains machine learning models using historical stock price data and the extracted features. Utilizes libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for model development.
    Comet ML (Experiment Tracking): Logs hyperparameters, metrics, and model performance during training for experiment tracking and reproducibility.

4. Inference Pipeline:

    Model Deployment (AWS Lambda or SageMaker): Deployed machine learning model as a service on AWS Lambda or Amazon SageMaker, providing an endpoint to receive input data and return predictions.
    InfluxDB or Amazon Timestream: Stores time-series data, including historical stock prices, real-time data, and predicted values. Supports querying for real-time and historical data retrieval.
    Comet ML (Model Versioning): Tracks model versions and performance metrics in Comet ML for model management and governance.

Workflow:

    Data Acquisition: Alpha Vantage API fetches real-time and historical stock price data, which is then pushed to the Kafka topic. AWS Lambda consumes this data for further processing.
    Feature Pipeline: Bytewax processes data from Kafka, performs normalization, and extracts features. Additional feature engineering steps are performed to enhance the feature set.
    Training Pipeline: Spark DataFrame processes real-time data streams, trains machine learning models, and logs experiment information using Comet ML.
    Inference Pipeline: The trained model is deployed on AWS Lambda or SageMaker for inference. Predictions are stored in the database (InfluxDB or Amazon Timestream), and model performance is tracked using Comet ML.

This breakdown allows for a modular and scalable system design, where each component focuses on a specific aspect of the overall workflow, from data acquisition to model deployment and inference.
